# ScalismoAD

This repository is based on Scalaad(Automatic differentiation for Scala) project that can be found [here](https://github.com/kogecoo/scalaad). 

In this detached-fork I'll attempt to combine [scalaad's](https://github.com/kogecoo/scalaad) automatic differentiation capabilities with [Scalismo - Scalable Image Analysis and Shape Modelling](https://github.com/unibas-gravis/scalismo) framework to improve [MCMC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo) sampling process by leveraging gradient based computations and [Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis-adjusted_Langevin_algorithm)

All the right goes to the original [author](https://github.com/kogecoo) until [commit#652ea8e](https://github.com/grigala/ScalismoAD/commit/652ea8e95507a6bdfa7c5cc7146d7f0288607608).
